# How to contribute

## Bugs / Issues

Report an issue in our github's repository following the issue template.

## Pull Requests

### For fixing bugs / issues

Remember to always add a link to the issue, pull requests for issues that weren't reported and accepted as bugs in our repo
won't be accepted.


### For new features

It's really important that any new feature comes with their corresponding test suites. Pull Requests without tests will be rejected.

### For refactors / cosmetic changes

* All the tests should be passing
* If new classes were added they should come with their corresponding test suites.
